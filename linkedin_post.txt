A productive time revisiting concepts from my BAMS 508: Optimal Decision Making course. I implemented a simulation using the SimPy library and refreshed my understanding of linear programming. 
The Kidney Paired Donation (KPD) program, managed by Canadian Blood Services (CBS), facilitates a voluntary kidney exchange for incompatible donor-patient pairs. KPD provides an opportunity to find a compatible match with another pair in the system. This project models a simplified version of this process, focusing on the core optimization problem of maximizing transplants through exchange cycles. Compatibility is determined by both blood type and a direct match in tissue type.
Formulating an integer linear programming problem with matrices and vectors on paper and coding it was a valuable exercise, deepening my understanding of variables, constraints, and network maximum flow problems. #OperationsResearch #LinearProgramming #Simulation #SimPy #DecisionMaking
